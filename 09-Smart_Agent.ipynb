This helps them understand that their actions can affect others and that they need to consider others' feelings and needs<sup><a href=\"https://demodatasetsp.blob.core.windows.net/books/Boundaries_When_to_Say_Yes_How_to_Say_No_to_Take_Control_of_Your_Life.pdf?sv=2022-11-02&ss=bf&srt=sco&sp=rltfx&se=2024-10-02T01:02:07Z&st=2023-08-03T17:02:07Z&spr=https&sig=gLxStXFSY6X29OPpPDpBEhoQDdtJNDrMVExNYJ%2BhmBQ%3D\" target=\"_blank\">[1]</a></sup>.\n",

Teach children to respect others\\' boundaries: Children need to learn not only to set their own boundaries but also to respect those set by others. This helps them understand that their actions can affect others and that they need to consider others\\' feelings and needs<sup><a href=\"https://demodatasetsp.blob.core.windows.net/books/Boundaries_When_to_Say_Yes_How_to_Say_No_to_Take_Control_of_Your_Life.pdf?sv=2022-11-02&ss=bf&srt=sco&sp=rltfx&se=2024-10-02T01:02:07Z&st=2023-08-03T17:02:07Z&spr=https&sig=gLxStXFSY6X29OPpPDpBEhoQDdtJNDrMVExNYJ%2BhmBQ%3D\" target=\"_blank\">[1]</a></sup>.\\n\\n2.

Help children internalize structure: By setting boundaries, you can help children internalize things that were external to them. This helps children develop character and prevent many problems that adults struggle with<sup><a href=\"https://demodatasetsp.blob.core.windows.net/books/Boundaries_When_to_Say_Yes_How_to_Say_No_to_Take_Control_of_Your_Life.pdf?sv=2022-11-02&ss=bf&srt=sco&sp=rltfx&se=2024-10-02T01:02:07Z&st=2023-08-03T17:02:07Z&spr=https&sig=gLxStXFSY6X29OPpPDpBEhoQDdtJNDrMVExNYJ%2BhmBQ%3D\" target=\"_blank\">[4]</a></sup>.\\n\\nRemember, setting boundaries with children is not about controlling them, but rather about teaching them to respect themselves and others.
